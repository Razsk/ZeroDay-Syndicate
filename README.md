## 🎮 Overview
**ZeroDay Syndicate** is a cyberpunk management & hacking sim.  
You buy servers, run SaaS businesses, discover Zero-Day Exploits (ZDEs), and wage digital warfare against AI competitors (or other players).  

- ⚡ **Run SaaS for profit** — but products decay over time.  
- 🧪 **Research exploits** — discover or replicate ZDEs during breaches.  
- 🕵️ **Silent breaches** — monitor without revealing your tools.  
- 💀 **Steal or sabotage** competitors — or launch new SaaS to outpace them.  
- 🌐 **Compete for market share** in multiple categories.

## 🧩 Core Loop
1. **Buy & allocate servers** → SaaS / Research / Development.  
2. **Run SaaS** → earn revenue, pay upkeep.  
3. **Research** → discover ZDEs or replicate from breaches.  
4. **Exploit rivals** → Monitor silently, Sabotage, or Steal SaaS code.  
5. **Develop new SaaS** → fight product aging, expand into categories.  
6. **Dominate the market** → outlive or outplay AI competitors.  

---

## 🖥️ Server Roles
- **SaaS Servers** → Revenue generation, vulnerable to ZDEs.  
- **Research Servers** → Find exploits; risk of theft.  
- **Development Servers** → Build new SaaS products.  
- **Clusters** → Pools of servers; breaches hit clusters individually.  

---

## 💾 Zero-Day Exploits (ZDEs)
- **Discovery**: Random chance per tick on research servers.  
- **Breach Replication**: +10× chance if you’re hit.  
- **Launch Options**:  
  - Silent Monitor → stays secret.  
  - Sabotage → disrupt rival revenue.  
  - Steal → clone rival SaaS.  
- **Immunity**: Once learned, all your servers are safe from that ZDE.  
- **Theft**: Rivals can hack your research servers to steal ZDEs.  

---

## 🧠 Competitors
- **AI-controlled** (multiplayer later).  
- Build SaaS, research ZDEs, and launch attacks.  
- Compete for TAM (Total Addressable Market) in each category.  

---

## 🕹️ Game Goals
- Short-term: Optimize revenue + defend servers.  
- Mid-term: Balance SaaS, research, and development.  
- Long-term: Market monopoly or survival with high profit.  

---

## 🖌️ Visual Style
- Dark cyberpunk neon (black, cyan, magenta, lime).  
- Server/competitor visualizations:  
  - **Hex-grid clusters** for tactical view.  
  - **Heatmap matrix** for category dominance.  
- Glitch animations + synthwave SFX for breaches and discoveries.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (planned)
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS (Neon UI), or WebGL for visualizations.  
- **Backend/AI**: Node.js (simulation loop), JSON save states.  
- **Persistence**: Local storage → cloud later.  

---

## 📅 Roadmap
- **MVP (3–4 mo)**: Servers, 1 SaaS category, ZDE basics, simple AI.  
- **Phase 2 (6–9 mo)**: Multi-categories, clusters, silent breaches, theft.  
- **Phase 3 (12+ mo)**: Multiplayer PvP, reputation system, advanced cyberwarfare.  

---

## ❓ Open Questions
- Should silent breaches hurt reputation if later exposed?  
- How frequent should ZDEs be?  
- Should categories have unique mechanics (e.g., Streaming = fast decay, Security = strong defense)?  
- Linear OPEX vs tiered costs (bandwidth/power scaling)?
